This is a simple test document for the IndabaX RAG demo.

It contains some basic information about machine learning and AI.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Key concepts include:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Deep learning
- Neural networks

This document is used to test the RAG system's ability to process and retrieve information.
