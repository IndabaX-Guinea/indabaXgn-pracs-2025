# Deep Learning IndabaX Guinea Practicals 2025

Welcome to the Deep Learning IndabaX Guinea 2025 practical sessions! This repository contains hands-on exercises designed to introduce participants to fundamental and advanced concepts in deep learning.

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a series of practical exercises covering:

1. **Practical 1: Introduction to Neural Networks**
   - Basic neural network concepts
   - Building your first neural network with PyTorch/TensorFlow
   - Forward and backward propagation
   - Loss functions and optimization

2. **Practical 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - Understanding convolution operations
   - Building CNNs for image classification
   - Working with popular architectures (VGG, ResNet)
   - Data augmentation techniques

3. **Practical 3: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
   - Sequential data processing
   - LSTMs and GRUs
   - Text classification and generation
   - Time series prediction

4. **Practical 4: Advanced Topics in Deep Learning**
   - Transfer learning
   - Fine-tuning pre-trained models
   - Attention mechanisms
   - Introduction to Transformers

5. **Practical 5: Deep Learning Projects**
   - End-to-end project implementation
   - Model evaluation and validation
   - Best practices and deployment considerations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus (helpful but not required)
- A computer with at least 8GB RAM (GPU recommended but not required)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IndabaX-Guinea/indabaXgn-pracs-2025.git
cd indabaXgn-pracs-2025
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 💻 Usage

Each practical session is contained in its own directory with:
- `notebook.ipynb`: The main practical exercises (with TODOs for you to complete)
- `solutions.ipynb`: Reference solutions (try to solve on your own first!)
- `README.md`: Additional context and learning resources

Navigate to each practical directory and open the notebook to get started.
